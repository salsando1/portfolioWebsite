			<h2><a id="heading1">Class Construction and Object<a></h2>
			<p>Object-Oriented programming or OOP is the concept of programming based on objects, object are used to build and design application. 
			The advantage of objects model real-world application, code reuse, encapsulation and design benefits (breaking a big problem in small object.)</p>
			<h3>C++</h3>
			<p>In c++ class, Construction consist of a .cpp and .h files. .h files are where class is defined and
			.cpp file is where class is implemented. .h have all the library we use in our object.</p>
			<div id="git0"></div>
			<p>Here we implemented are overloaded constructor and default constructor.</p>
			<div id="git1"></div>	
	        <p>Here we implemented are overloaded method.</p>
			<div id="git2"></div>
			<br>
			<div id="git3"></div>
			<p>Here is where we make use of are overloaded constructor</p>
			<div id="git4"></div>
			<p>Here is where we make use of are overloaded method.</p>
			<div id="git20"></div>
			<h3>C#</h3>
			<p>C# only use one file per class  of files is .cs.Here is where we declared are default
			constructor and overloaded constructor. Also, this constructor call the base constructor from sprocket class.</p>

			<p>Here is where we define are overloaded constructor. We initialize member variable through constructor.</p>
			<div id="git5"></div>
			<p>Here is where we define are overloaded method.</p>
			<div id="git6"></div>
			<p>Here we implement one of the method. Were we only add to the end of the list. 
			We still have the option in the future if we want to implement adding at certain position.</p> 
            <div id="git7"></div>			
			<h3>Java</h3>
			<p>Java  like C# we can declare and define are class in the same file. The java files have the extension of file.java</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is where I declare my overloaded constructor.</p>			
			<div id="git8"></div>			
			<p>Here is where I declare my overloaded mutator. </p>
			<div id="git9"></div>			
			<p>Here I decide to use the overloaded method by using int.</p>
			<div id="git10"></div>			
		    <p>Here a use the overloaded method by passing string and int.</p>	
		   <div id="git11"></div>			
           <p></p>		   
          
		  <h2><a id="heading2">Inheritance and Polymorphism<a></h2>
		  <p>Inheritance is important because it allow us to reuse code.
		  Example if we have a base class vehicle. Member variable 
		  that contains tire, motor, color. We can create a child 
		  class call truck inherit all those Qualities just add cargo bed
		  variable. This way we do not to write the whole class.</p>
		   <h3>C#</h3>
	       <p>Game object is going to be are base class</p>
	       <div id="git12"></div>					
		   <p>Here is where tell the compiler this child class and we are going to inherit from this base class.</p>   
		   <div id="git13"></div>						
		   <p>Since we inherit from Game object. Alien is the same data type as Game object.</p>
		   <div id="git14"></div>						
		   <h2><a id="heading3">Graphical User Interface Construction</a></h2>
		   <p>The Most modern Graphical user interface for windows is Windows
		   form.  Windows form is from .Net framework. We start by 
		   inherit from window.  We get the basics just a frame like 
		   in swing. We can start adding are controllers through 
		   the XAML.</p>
		   <div id="git15"></div>
		   <p>What makes windows form more dynamic is XAML. You can easily make 
		   changes to your GUI. Nest controllers inside of controllers. 
		   Initialize the GUI like when launch certain check box needs to be
		   check with a line of code.</p>
		   <div class="overflowdiv"><img src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/csGuiMaiinScreeen.JPG"  alt="c++ class construction" height="575" width="646"></div>
		   <p>Dialogs are important so you can tell the user if he is doing something wrong.</p>
		   <div class="overflowdiv"><img src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/csGuiDialog.JPG"  alt="c++ class construction" height="590" width="685"></div>
		    <p>Another way you can interact with the user is by writing the result or probably an order like following.</p> 
		   <div id="git16"></div>
		   
		   <h2><a id="heading4">Database manipulation</a></h2>
		   <h3>C#</h3>
		   <p>GUI are important especially when you can combined with a 
		   connection through a database. .Since Microsoft have its Microsoft 
		   SQL server.  C# library for Microsoft SQL is sqlClient. Allow as to 
		   connect to database and query the database without using SQL syntax.</p>
		   <div id="git17"></div>
		   <p>Here is how we create are connection to server. Also, how we 
		   open the connection and make sure if anything goes wrong we closed
		   the connection.</p>
		   <div id="git18"></div>
           <p>Here is how we Query the database for example update statement.</p>		   
		   <div id="git19"></div>

			<p>after setting the hours the program actually give the option to add an employee </p>
			<div class="overflowdiv"><img id="schedule3" src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/schedule3.JPG" height="577" width="1226"></div>
			<p>Second, tell the program total hours and days off you need.</p>
			<img id="schedule4" src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/schedule4.JPG" height="280" width="444">
			<p>Lastly, the program prints the schedule with the main screen you can modify the schedule as you please.</p>
            <div class="overflowdiv"><img id="schedule5" src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/schedule5.JPG" height="582" width="1216"></div>
			<h3> Data class</h3>
			<h4>Time Class</h4>
			<p>The time class has the ability to accept time in am or pm and 24 hours. Also, the time gives the
			total hours and minutes the from the time. Time return a formatted string time.</p>
			<div id="git1"></div>
			<h4>Schedule class</h4>
			<p>Schedule class is the one who holds time. Also has the ability to add all the week minutes and 
			hours. The schedule also has the ability to return a formatted string method the return a formatted schedule.</p>
			<div id="git2"></div>
			<h4>Schedule Generator</h4>
			<p>First, the class checks if requested working hours is in the range of business hours.</p>
			<div id="git3"></div>
			<p>Second, working hours are divided randomly in the week, the way this actually works randomly 
			get day subtract 30 minutes from working hours and add to date. Stop until working hours reach 0.</p>
			<div id="git4"></div>
			<p>Lastly, randomly choose is going to open or closed. If open is selected start counting 
			from opening else if closed is selected start counting from closed time.</p>
			<div id="git5"></div>
			<h2><a id="heading2">Timekeeping Android App with CRUD using SQLite <a></h2>
			<p>This program store time and tells you hours and minutes you have made so far.</p>
		    <h3>The flow of the program.</h3>
			<p>The main screen shows all the hours you did so far.</p>
			<div class="overflowdiv"><img src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/TimeKeeping1.PNG" height="1093" width="583"></div>
			<p>If you want to see the total hours you did on a day you can touch the date and dialog will 
			show you time and total hours for the day. You can add another time by touching the plus sign in the dialog.</p>
			<div class="overflowdiv"><img src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/TimeKeeping2.PNG" height="1089" width="564"></div>
			<div class="overflowdiv"><img src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/TimeKeeping3.PNG" height="1079" width="559"></div>
			<p>If you want to add another date you can do that on the main screen. This screen shows you a calendar as 
			well. The program also can delete all records or delete by date. </p>
			<div class="overflowdiv"><img src="http://ssandoval114.com/jsonFiles/TimeKeeping5.PNG" height="1096" width="560"></div>			
			<h3> Class the handle data</h3>
			<h4>TimeKeepingCursorAdapter Class</h4>
			<p>We use a simple cursor adapter. This class helps us to put data in a listview.</p>
			<div id="git6"></div>
			<h4>TimeKeepinginDbAdapter Class</h4>
			<p>This class is the one who queries the database.</p>
			<div id="git7"></div>
			<h2><a id="heading3">Portfolio Website<a></h2>
			<h3> Floatdiv</h3>
			<p>The code check when the top of the browser reaches the main content then div start moving to the top of the
			browser. If you pass the top of main content then stop and stay there.</p>
			<div id="git8"></div>
             <h3>Button action</h3>
			 <p>Since the website uses Ajax.  The h2 constantly changes then JavaScript copy and create a new anchor. Also, 
			 this same part adds a new title to floatdiv that relate to what you seeing.</p>
			 <div id="git9"></div>
			 <h3>Listener for h2</h3>
			 <p>The listener make a change to anchor on floatdiv, every time top  of browser pass h2<p/>

"description":" <article><br><h2><a id=\"heading1\">Class Construction and Object<a><\/h2><p>Object-Oriented programming or OOP is the concept of programming based on objects, object are used to build and design application. The advantage of objects model real-world application, code reuse, encapsulation and design benefits (breaking a big problem in small object.)<\/p><h3>C++<\/h3><p>In c++ class, Construction consist of a .cpp and .h files. .h files are where class is defined and .cpp file is where class is implemented. .h have all the library we use in our object.<\/p><div id=\"git0\"><\/div><p>Here we implemented are overloaded constructor and default constructor.<\/p><div id=\"git1\"><\/div><p>Here we implemented are overloaded method.<\/p><div id=\"git2\"><\/div><br><div id=\"git3\"><\/div><p>Here is where we make use of are overloaded constructor<\/p><div id=\"git4\"><p>Here is where we make use of are overloaded method.<\/p><div id=\"git20\"></div><\/div><h3>C#<\/h3><p>C# only use one file per class  of files is .cs.Here is where we declared are default constructor and overloaded constructor. Also, this constructor call the base constructor from sprocket class.<\/p><p>Here is where we define are overloaded constructor. We initialize member variable through constructor.<\/p><div id=\"git5\"><\/div><p>Here is where we define are overloaded method.<\/p><div id=\"git6\"><\/div><p>Here we implement one of the method. Were we only add to the end of the list. We still have the option in the future if we want to implement adding at certain position.<\/p><div id=\"git7\"><\/div><h3>Java<\/h3><p>Java  like C# we can declare and define are class in the same file. The java files have the extension of file.java<\/p><br><p>Here is where I declare my overloaded constructor.<\/p><div id=\"git8\"><\/div><p>Here is where I declare my overloaded mutator. <\/p><div id=\"git9\"><\/div><p>Here I decide to use the overloaded method by using int.<\/p><div id=\"git10\"><\/div><p>Here a use the overloaded method by passing string and int.<\/p><div id=\"git11\"><\/div><h2><a id=\"heading2\">Inheritance and Polymorphism<a><\/h2><p>Inheritance is important because it allow us to reuse code. Example if we have a base class vehicle. Member variable that contains tire, motor, color. We can create a child class call truck inherit all those Qualities just add cargo bed variable. This way we do not to write the whole class.<\/p><h3>C#<\/h3><p>Game object is going to be are base class<\/p><div id=\"git12\"><\/div><p>Here is where tell the compiler this child class and we are going to inherit from this base class.<\/p><div id=\"git13\"><\/div><p>Since we inherit from Game object. Alien is the same data type as Game object.<\/p><div id=\"git14\"><\/div><h2><a id=\"heading3\">Graphical User Interface Construction<\/a><\/h2><p>The Most modern Graphical user interface for windows is Windows form.  Windows form is from .Net framework. We start by inherit from window.  We get the basics just a frame like in swing. We can start adding are controllers through the XAML.<\/p><div id=\"git15\"><\/div><p>What makes windows form more dynamic is XAML. You can easily make changes to your GUI. Nest controllers inside of controllers. Initialize the GUI like when launch certain check box needs to be check with a line of code.<\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/ssandoval114.com\/jsonFiles\/csGuiMaiinScreeen.JPG\"  alt=\"c++ class construction\" height=\"575\" width=\"646\"><p>Dialogs are important so you can tell the user if he is doing something wrong.<\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/ssandoval114.com\/jsonFiles\/csGuiDialog.JPG\"  alt=\"c++ class construction\" height=\"590\" width=\"685\"><p>Another way you can interact with the user is by writing the result or probably an order like following.<\/p><div id=\"git16\"><\/div><h2><a id=\"heading4\">Database manipulation<\/a><\/h2><h3>C#<\/h3><p>GUI are important especially when you can combined with a connection through a database. .Since Microsoft have its Microsoft SQL server.  C# library for Microsoft SQL is sqlClient. Allow as to connect to database and query the database without using SQL syntax.<\/p><div id=\"git17\"><\/div><p>Here is how we create are connection to server. Also, how we open the connection and make sure if anything goes wrong we closed the connection.<\/p><div id=\"git18\"><\/div><p>Here is how we Query the database for example update statement.<\/p><div id=\"git19\"><\/div><br><br><br><\/article>"
